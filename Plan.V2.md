- **Week 1 — Scope shift: from team impact to org impact**
    - Differences in scope and responsibilities: Senior vs Staff vs Principal
    - Operating radius: single team → multi-team → org-wide systems/standards
    - Time horizon: weeks/months → quarters/years
    - Ownership: technical health, quality, reliability, and long-term evolution (not just delivery)
    - Driving outcomes in ambiguous spaces (problem-finding, not just problem-solving)
- **Week 2 — Staff archetypes + choosing your operating model**
    - Tech Lead (critical area delivery + deep technical ownership)
    - Architect (cross-team system design + patterns/standards)
    - Solver (hard problems, incident/scale/complexity “fixer”)
    - Right Hand (exec-adjacent leverage + strategic initiatives)
    - Selecting a primary/secondary archetype and defining engagement model across teams
- **Weeks 3–8 — Architecture deep dives (platform/microservices)**
	- Consistency models (strong vs eventual), coordination cost
	- Availability and graceful degradation
	- Failure behavior: partial failure, dependency collapse, cascading failures
	- Retry strategy: timeouts, exponential backoff, jitter
	- Idempotency and deduplication patterns
	- Service boundaries, coupling vs cohesion, domain-driven boundaries
	- Data architecture: caching, replication, sharding/partitioning, hotspots
	- Backpressure, rate limiting, load shedding
	- API governance: versioning, backward compatibility, schema evolution
	- Migrations and long-term system evolution (de-risking change over time)
- **Weeks 9–12 — Observability, reliability, and operating at scale**
	- Observability foundations: metrics, logs, traces, request context
	- “Golden signals” thinking (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
	- SLI/SLO design and error budgets (reliability as an explicit contract)
	- Alerting quality: noise reduction, burn-rate alerting concepts
	- Incident leadership: roles, comms, decision-making under pressure
	- Postmortems that drive systemic improvement (prevent/detect/mitigate)
	- Observability at scale: cardinality control, sampling, retention tiering, cost tradeoffs
	- Platform-level instrumentation standards (“paved road” telemetry)
- **Weeks 13–14 — Security, privacy, and compliance as design constraints**
	- Threat modeling: assets, trust boundaries, attack paths, mitigations
	- AuthN/AuthZ patterns, least privilege, secrets management
	- Secure defaults in shared platforms (guardrails, policy-as-code mindset)
	- Data governance: classification, retention, deletion/erasure, auditability
	- Encryption in transit/at rest, key management basics
	- Designing systems to satisfy regulatory/compliance expectations (practical, not legal-heavy)
- **Weeks 15–20 — Soft skills (Staff/Principal differentiator)**
	- Leading without authority: stakeholder mapping, incentives, coalition building
	- Influence tactics: pre-wiring, framing tradeoffs, creating alignment
	- Communication: writing crisp proposals, running effective design reviews
	- Technical storytelling (Staff interview narratives): ambiguity, tradeoffs, leverage, outcomes
	- Strategy and vision: multi-quarter planning, defining “bets,” measurable outcomes
	- Conflict handling: disagree-and-commit, decision frameworks, escalation hygiene
	- Mentorship at scale: leveling up senior engineers, raising org bar
	- “Managing up” and sideways: no-surprises, sponsorship, director/VP alignment, expectation management
	- Principal-style enablement: standards, paved roads, adoption plans, org-wide effectiveness improvements
